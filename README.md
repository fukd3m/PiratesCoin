PiratesCoin welcomes individuals from all over the world to use it for peertopeer transactions.
The projects creator shares the same ideas with the bitcoin creator satoshi nakamoto on using this technology as a replacement of the todays outdated currencies.
Our view is that the existing coins failed to bring satoshis idea into the world and instead are used for economic profit.
In the future humanity will evolve into using blockchain technology for every digital transaction to be made without additional costs and safety concerns tha come with todays centralized financial system.
PiratesCoins goal is to serve the global community as a new digital currency to buy and sell from peer to peer.
